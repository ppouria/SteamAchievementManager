# Steam Achievement Manager (Fork)

This repository is a fork of the original Steam Achievement Manager project.

- Fork repository: `https://github.com/ppouria/SteamAchievementManager`
- Latest release: `https://github.com/ppouria/SteamAchievementManager/releases/latest`

## Overview

Steam Achievement Manager (SAM) is a desktop tool to manage Steam achievements and stats.
It requires:

- Steam client running
- A logged-in Steam account
- Network access (for Steam API / community endpoints when needed)

## Fork Notes

This fork adds and improves several features compared to the base upstream state, including:

- Steam Community auth dialog (single dialog for cookie-based auth values).
- Better owned-games loading by combining available data sources.
- Achievement scan modes including `Check All` sequential scan.
- Achievement status database output at:
  - `data/games/achievements/status.json`
- Automatic status DB updates after storing/resetting achievements in `SAM.Game`.
- Filter-based operations in picker (works with current visible game list).
- `Unlock All` in picker:
  - Processes only currently visible games (respects active filters).
  - Unlocks achievements per game sequentially.
  - Skips protected achievements (red / non-manageable).
- Grid/list view options with sorting and persisted picker preferences.
- Built-in scan log viewer and automatic log reset to avoid log growth.

## CI / Releases

Builds and release artifacts are generated by GitHub Actions workflows in this repository.
